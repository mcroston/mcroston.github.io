Hello! I am a doctoral candidate in the Public Health Sciences program at Washington University in St. Louis, [Chancellor’s Graduate fellow](https://provost.wustl.edu/items/chancellors-graduate-fellowship-program/), [Spencer T. and Ann W. Olin fellow](https://provost.wustl.edu/items/chancellors-graduate-fellowship-program/), and an inaugural recipient of the [Center for Critical Internet Inquiry’s Tech Impact Network Dissertation Fellowship](https://twitter.com/C2i2_UCLA/status/1534875709188997120) at the University of California, Los Angeles. I have theoretical and applied research interests in how and why health misinformation spreads on the internet and how to combat it. Current projects use social network analysis and traditional statistics to evaluate fact-checking approaches and to explore the ways in which COVID-19 misinformation spreads on Twitter compared to other information types. My dissertation research examines the prevelance and diffusion dynamics of popular COVID-19 misinformation narratives on Black Twitter. In addition to my research interests, I am devoted to promoting gender and racial diversity in data science.
