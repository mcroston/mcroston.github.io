Brief Bio
------
Merriah Croston is a doctoral candidate in the Public Health Sciences program at Washington University in St. Louis. She is a Chancellor’s Graduate fellow, Spencer T. and Ann W. Olin fellow, and inaugural recipient of the Center for Critical Internet Inquiry’s Tech Impact Network Dissertation Fellowship at University of California, Los Angeles. Merriah has theoretical and applied research interests in how and why health misinformation spreads on the internet and how to combat it. Her current projects use social network analysis and traditional statistics to evaluate fact-checking approaches and to explore the ways in which COVID-19 misinformation spreads on Twitter compared to other information types.

Merriah has over 10 years of public health experience. Prior to pursuing a PhD, she held scientific positions at agencies such as the Georgia Department of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She earned a Bachelor of Science from Georgetown University and a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology from Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health and is a former Gates Millennium Scholar. In addition to her scholarly interests, Merriah is devoted to promoting gender and racial diversity in data science.
