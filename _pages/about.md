This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Merriah Croston is a doctoral candidate in the Public Health Sciences program at Washington University in St. Louis. She is a Chancellor’s Graduate fellow, Spencer T. and Ann W. Olin fellow, and inaugural recipient of the Center for Critical Internet Inquiry’s Tech Impact Network Dissertation Fellowship at University of California, Los Angeles. Merriah has theoretical and applied research interests in how and why health misinformation spreads on the internet and how to combat it. Her current projects use social network analysis and traditional statistics to evaluate fact-checking approaches and to explore the ways in which COVID-19 misinformation spreads on Twitter compared to other information types.

Merriah has over 10 years of public health experience. Prior to pursuing a PhD, she held scientific positions at agencies such as the Georgia Department of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
